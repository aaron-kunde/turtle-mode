* Introduction
  We define the this mode according to the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-turtle-20140225/][W3C recommendation]].

* Define mode
  We defint the mode, by deriving from the [[https://github.com/aaron-kunde/ntriple-mode][N-Triple mode]] adding the following
  lines:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'ntriple-mode)

    (define-derived-mode turtle-mode ntriple-mode "Turtle"
      "Major mode for editing RDF files serialized in Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language (W3C recommendation REC-turtle-20140225) notation.")
  #+END_SRC

* Simple triples
  Simple triples are the same as in N-Triple mode and are treated the same.
